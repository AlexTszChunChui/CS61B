# CS61B

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments and projects for CS61B: Data Structures and Algorithms, a course offered by the University of California, Berkeley.

## Overview

The CS61B course covers a range of topics related to data structures and algorithms, including:

-   Object-oriented programming in Java
-   Lists, arrays, and linked lists
-   Stacks, queues, and priority queues
-   Binary search trees and balanced search trees
-   Hash tables
-   Graphs and graph algorithms
-   Sorting and searching algorithms

The repository is organized by week, with each week containing the relevant assignments and projects. Each week's folder contains a README file that explains the purpose of the assignments and projects and provides instructions on how to run the code.

## Assignments

The assignments are designed to help students learn the course material by providing practice problems that reinforce the concepts covered in the lectures. Each assignment focuses on a specific topic and includes a set of coding problems that students must solve using Java.

## Projects

The projects are larger assignments that build upon the concepts covered in the lectures and assignments. They require students to design and implement complex data structures and algorithms that solve real-world problems.

The projects include:

-   Project 0: 2048
-   Project 1: Data Structures
-   Project 2: Gitlet
-   Project 3: BYOW (Build Your Own World)
