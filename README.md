# CS61B SP21

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments and projects for CS61B: Data Structures and Algorithms Spring 2021 semester, a course offered by the University of California, Berkeley.

## Overview

The CS61B course covers a range of topics related to data structures and algorithms, including:

-   Object-oriented programming in Java
-   Lists, arrays, and linked lists
-   Stacks, queues, and priority queues
-   Binary search trees and balanced search trees
-   Hash tables
-   Graphs and graph algorithms
-   Sorting and searching algorithms

The repository is organized by week, with each week containing the relevant assignments and projects. Each week's folder contains a README file that explains the purpose of the assignments and projects and provides instructions on how to run the code.

## Assignments

The assignments are designed to help students learn the course material by providing practice problems that reinforce the concepts covered in the lectures. Each assignment focuses on a specific topic and includes a set of coding problems that students must solve using Java.

## Projects

The projects are larger assignments that build upon the concepts covered in the lectures and assignments. They require students to design and implement complex data structures and algorithms that solve real-world problems.

The projects include:

-   Project 0: 2048
-   Project 1: Data Structures
-   Project 2: Gitlet
-   Project 3: BYOW (Build Your Own World)

# CS61A

This repository contains my solutions to the CS61A course assignments from UC Berkeley.

The course covers the basics of programming, including data abstraction, recursion, higher-order functions, control structures, data structures, and object-oriented programming. The assignments include:

-   Hog: A dice game where two players compete to be the first to reach a certain score. Implemented using control structures and higher-order functions.
-   Cats: A typing speed measurement program featured with typing autocorrect
-   Ants: A game where the player controls a colony of ants defending against invaders. Implemented using object-oriented programming.
-   Scheme: A simplified implementation of the Scheme programming language. Implemented using recursion and higher-order functions.

All code is written in Python and Scheme.

## Notes

-   These solutions were completed during the Fall 2020 semester.
-   Solutions to some of the optional questions are included.
-   Tests are not included in this repository.
-   This repository does not contain the starter code provided by the course.

## Acknowledgments

-   The course materials were provided by UC Berkeley. And was designed by all the CS61B course staff. Thank you to the staff for creating such a fun and educational program!
