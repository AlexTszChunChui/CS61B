# Build Your Own World (BYOW) Game

This project is the third assignment of CS61B: Data Structures at UC Berkeley. It is a Java-based game that allows the player to explore a random world generated by the program.

## Installation

To run the program, make sure you have Java 8 installed on your computer. Clone this repository using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/AlexTszChunChui/CS61B.git` 

Navigate to the BYOW folder using the following command:

`cd CS61B/proj3/byow` 

Compile the program using the following command:

`javac Main.java`

Finally, run the program using the following command:

`java Main`

## Usage

Once the program is running, you can use the keyboard to control the player and explore the generated world. The following keys are available:

-   `W`: move the player up

-   `C`: open control menu

The game also allows the player to interact with certain elements in the world, such as picking up items or opening doors.

## Features
